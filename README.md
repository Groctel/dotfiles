# Groctel's dotfiles

**Here are my dotfiles.
They are files made out of text on a directory tree with nothing.
Add them to your system if you want, I couldn't care less.** *Ron Swanson*

## Dotfiles manager

I'm using [Dotfiler](https://github.com/Groctel/dotfiles-manager), my own dotfiles manager.
It can be updated to the latest version with this command:

```sh
curl -fLo dotfiler.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Groctel/dotfiles-manager/main/dotfiler.sh
```
