Groctel's dotfiles
==================

**Here are my dotfiles.
They are files made out of text on a directory tree with nothing.
Add them to your system if you want, I couldn't care less.**
*Ron Swanson*

System requirements
-------------------

These dotfiles come from an [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) system and require [`yay`](
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/) to install all the `laptop` packages, since many come from the AUR.

Dotfiles manager
----------------

I'm using [Dotfiler](https://github.com/Groctel/dotfiles-manager), my own dotfiles manager.
It can be updated to the latest version with this command:

```sh
curl -fLo dotfiler.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Groctel/dotfiles-manager/main/dotfiler.sh
```

Legacy versions
